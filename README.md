## Reverse Engineering / Key Gen Challenge

Greetings to all challenge enthusiasts! Dive into this reverse engineering task designed to put your skills to the test.

**Objective**: Develop a `Key Gen` â€“ a script or function that consistently produces valid keys for the provided program. While creating the key generator is the primary goal, you are also encouraged to find other methods to make the program return **Valid Key**.

**Resources**:
- A [ZIP file](https://github.com/DylanMcBean/CrackMe1/releases/tag/builds) containing:
  - Compiled versions of the challenge for both Linux and Windows.
- The source code. (To avoid spoilers, don't read this)
- A list of 1000 valid keys for pattern analysis enthusiasts.

**Notes**:
- The executables might be flagged by Anti-Virus software due to the embedded anti-debugging techniques. But rest assured, it's part of the challenge.
- You can potentially simplify the challenge by reading the provided source code. However, for a genuine challenge experience, avoid peeking!
- If you opt to compile from scratch for an added layer of complexity, compile in release mode, enable optimizations, and strip the executable of any function names.
